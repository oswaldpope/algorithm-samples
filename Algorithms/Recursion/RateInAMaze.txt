         Following is the solution matrix(output of program) for the above input matrx.
        
                 {1, 0, 0, 0}
                 {1, 1, 0, 0}
                 {0, 1, 0, 0}
                 {0, 1, 1, 1}
  All enteries in solution path are marked as 1.
 Naive Algorithm
 The Naive Algorithm is to generate all paths from source to destination and one by one check if the generated path satisfies the constraints.
 
 while there are untried paths
 {
             generate the next path
    if this path has all blocks as 1
    {
                 print this path;
             }
         }
         Backtrackng Algorithm
 
 If destination is reached
     print the solution matrix
 Else
    a) Mark current cell in solution matrix as 1. 
    b) Move forward in horizontal direction and recursively check if this 
        move leads to a solution.
    c) If the move chosen in the above step doesn't lead to a solution
        then move down and check if  this move leads to a solution.
    d) If none of the above solutions work then unmark this cell as 0 
        (BACKTRACK) and return false.
